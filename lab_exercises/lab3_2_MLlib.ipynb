    "\n",
    ">Tracking Parkinson's disease (PD) symptom progression often uses the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), which requires the patient's presence in clinic, and time-consuming physical examinations by trained medical staff. Thus, symptom monitoring is costly and logistically inconvenient for patient and clinical staff alike, also hindering recruitment for future large-scale clinical trials. [...] We characterize speech with signal processing  algorithms, and statistically map these algorithms to UPDRS. We verify our findings on the largest database of PD speech in existence (~6,000 recordings from 42 PD patients, recruited to a six-month, multi-centre trial).\n",
